# CodeLab - Learning Platform

A simple coding learning platform built for students to learn HTML, C++, and Python programming languages.

## What is CodeLab?

CodeLab is a web application that helps students learn programming through interactive lessons, quizzes, and a code editor. Students can track their progress and practice coding directly in the browser.
